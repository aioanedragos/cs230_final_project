<html>The Affine Cipher is a type of cipher
in which each letter in an alphabet is matched
with its numeric equivalent, encrypted using
the function C = kP + s (mod 26) where k,sÂ 
are integers and P is the value associated 
with the letter from the message. Deciphering 
the text requires the function P = q(C-s) (mod 26) 
where C is the value of the encrypted letter, 
q is k's inverse mod 26, and s is the same shift 
value as before. For the Affine Cipher in our 
code cracker C = 9*P + 3 (mod 26) and P = 3*(C-3) (mod 26). 
In other words, decrypt the Affine cipher by shifting 
your character back three letters in the alphabet, 
multiplying that characters value by three, and 
then subtract 26 until you have a value between 
0 and 25 (if your number after multiplying is 
between 0 and 25 then don't subtract anything).
