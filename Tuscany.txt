\f0\fs32 \cf0 The year is 44 BC, and you are a member of a secret detective group in ancient Rome. A month before today on the Ides of March a group of Roman Senators led by Marcus Brutus allegedly stabbed Julius Caesar, Dictator of the Roman Republic, to death. However, your small posse of detectives suspects a cover-up. Was Julius Caesar really taken by surprise, or was he a co-conspirator in his own murder? To discover the answer decode the message found on Caesar\'92s dresser using the Caesar Cipher.
