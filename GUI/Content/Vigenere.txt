The Vigenere Cipher is an extension of the Caesar Cipher -- it is a method of encryption by using a series of different Caesar Ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. In the cipher, the keyword is made to be the length of the message (so if the message is "computerscience" and the keyword is “cats,” you can rewrite the keyword as "catscatscatscat" -- 15 characters, the same as the message. Then, each character in the original message is shifted, using a Caesar Cipher, by the shift value that the respective/corresponding character in keyword represents (where c is 2, a is 0, etc.). So in our example, "computerscience" would become "eofhwtxjucbwpcx." In our game, we have used the keyword "Wendy".
