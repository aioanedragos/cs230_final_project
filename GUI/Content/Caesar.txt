<html>One way to think about the Caesar ciphers
is that they are often also called "Shift
Ciphers" -- as you may be able to deduce,
the Caesar Cipher consists of shifting ea-
ch letter of the alphabet by a set number
to create a new "alphabet" with which the
decrypted message is written. For example,
in a Caesar cipher of shift 3, A would be-
come D, B would become E, Y would become B
and so on. In this game, we have shifted 
the alphabet forward by 3 characters. See 
if you can decrypt the message!
